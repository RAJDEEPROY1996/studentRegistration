Task-1 
Create a simple dApp using Web3.js that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
The dApp can have a simple user interface that allows users to input data and interact with the smart contract.
The candidate can use tools like Truffle and Ganache to create and deploy the smart contract, and test it locally before deploying it on the mainnet.
The dApp can have basic functionalities like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data on the blockchain.
